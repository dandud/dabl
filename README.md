# dabl - Brew Log

Reposity for dabl a web application built using the Python and the Flask web framework.  

### **Purpose:**
* Provide a means to log home brewing activities and correlate measurements and metrics to specific batches. 
* Further my own knowledge and as the name suggests, to dabble :) 

### **Primary Goals**
* Provide way to input batch information and display current status
* Provide a way to add record of measurements (specific gravity, temperature, etc.) and actions (racking, degassing, additions, etc.) and associate with specific batches
* Provide method to view a batch and its associate measurements and actions

General Notes 
* I have scripted in python before, but I have never utilized flask and have limited experience in web design. 
* For the base application template I am pulling heavily from the [sample application](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky) that accompanies Miguel Grinberg's Flask Web Development Second Edition.
